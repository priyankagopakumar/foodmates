# foodmates
Foodmates was an early stage iOS app built as a part of a hackathon. It was meant to be the Tinder of home cooked meals (yep that sounds weird), helping college students that cook food in large quantities, to overcome "food boredom" by swapping their meals for meals posted by others around them.
